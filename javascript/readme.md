TextDown is made using Javascript and it uses some of these libraries:

+ [Keymaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster), for keyboard shortcuts.
+ [Showdown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown), to parse Markdown.
+ [JS Beautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/), to output a well formated html.
+ [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/), to generate and save files.

## MarkdownEditor.js

Is a tool I made for TextDown that allows you to transform a simple textarea into a smart markdown editor(not cross-browser yet).
